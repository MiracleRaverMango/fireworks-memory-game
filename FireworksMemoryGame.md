# 🎇 Fireworks Memory Game

## Overview
This project began as a simple interactive snippet assignment (hover effects, button clicks, and small animations). I expanded the idea into a **mini memory game** inspired by *Simon Says* and arcade-style fireworks shows.  

Players watch a sequence of fireworks explode across the screen, then must **click the bursts back in order** to advance. Each round adds a new firework to the sequence, increasing the challenge. Survive 10 rounds and the sky erupts into a **chaotic fireworks finale**.

## ✨ Features
- **3 Difficulty Modes**  
  - **Assist:** Large hint rings + unlimited replays.  
  - **Normal:** Smaller rings, one replay per round with tooltip.  
  - **Hard:** No hints, only subtle adaptive blinks if you fail or idle.  

- **Adaptive Grace System**  
  Hard mode adjusts tolerance dynamically: more forgiving after misses, tighter after successes.  

- **Replay Button with Tooltip**  
  Normal mode allows one replay per round, clearly indicated by a greying-out effect.  

- **Endless Mode (optional)**  
  After round 10, the game continues ramping up in speed — perfect for high score bragging rights.  

- **Fireworks Finale**  
  Winning round 10 unleashes layered bursts, confetti volleys, sweeping explosions, and a celebratory chaos show.

## 🎮 Gameplay Flow
1. **Observe** the firework sequence.  
2. **Repeat** the clicks in the correct order.  
3. **Advance** to longer sequences each round.  
4. Reach round 10 → **Grand Finale fireworks show**.  
5. Optional: continue into **Endless Mode** for leaderboard-style scores.

## 🔍 Challenges
- Balancing **Hard mode**: challenging but never unfair.  
- Syncing **timing ramps** so gameplay feels progressively faster.  
- Designing **visual effects** that are eye-catching yet performant.

## 🚀 Outcome
The final product is a **fun, replayable browser game** that merges interactivity, visuals, and game design polish. It grew far beyond the original brief, demonstrating skills in:  
- Game logic & state management  
- Difficulty balancing  
- UX/UI polish  
- Particle animations with Canvas

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add an **instructions overlay** for first-time players.  
- Refine the **high score UI** (separate endless mode leaderboard).  
- Deploy a **live demo** via GitHub Pages.
